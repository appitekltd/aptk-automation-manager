# Automation Manager
 Manage and export all of your Salesforce automations for keywords, including Validation Rules, Workflows, Process Builders, Triggers, and Apex Classes.

## About ##
This is a free tool we created to allow admins to export their automation in a more 'user friendly' format.

It is currently hosted on our [website](https://www.appitek.com/tools/automation-manager/), and is free to use for anyone. You just log in to the Salesforce org you want to export data from, and the data is pulled in locally to your browser.

None of your data leaves the platform or is stored in local data / cookies.

## Using within Salesforce ##
If you want to use this tool directly in Salesforce rather than from our website, you can install [this unmanaged package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t4J000000rMjd).

This package contains the `AutomationManager.vfp` Visualforce Page, the `AutomationManagerResource` Static Resource, and a custom VF Tab for the page. 

## Bugs ##
If you find any issues please let us know! We try our best to keep our free tools updated and in working order, but cannot be held responsible for any issues that occur from using them.
